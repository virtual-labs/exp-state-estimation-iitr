## Procedure for Newton-Raphson power flow
<b>STEP 1</b>: Enter the number of lines in a power system. Then, click on the “Generate Line Table” and fill the details of lines i.e., From, To, R(pu), X (pu), B/2 (pu).  
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Line data for an standard IEEE 5-Bus system is provided. To access the data click on the button of Autofill Line Data: IEEE 5-Bus Lines.
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 2</b>: Enter the total measurements data in a power system. Then, click on the “Generate Measurement Table” and fill the measurement data i.e., Type (Types of Measurement Data: Type:1 Voltage, Type:2 Real power injection, Type:3 Reactive power injection, Type:4 Real power flow, Type:5 Reactive power flow and In Type:1 Voltage, Type:2 Real power injection, Type:3 Reactive power injection only From Bus is applicable) , From, To, Value, and Rii (error in measurement).   
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Measurement data for an standard IEEE 5-Bus system is provided. To access the data click on the button of Autofill Line Data: IEEE 5-Bus Measurement Data.
<br>
<br>
<b>STEP 3</b>: Enter the value of “Tolerance” and "No. of Iteration". Click on “Run State Estimation”. The values of the states estimated will be displayed i.e., Bus: Voltage magnitude (V (pu)) and Angle (degree).
